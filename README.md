This project uses the Google Maps API to show a map, load a list of places by type, and search within these places.

To run the code, you need to obtain Google Maps API and Foursquare API keys. Copy the file `js/config.js.in` to `js/config.js` and add your API keys to the file.

Then, run a local web server in the root directory of the project (I use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`) or copy the files to your web server.
